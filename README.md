# Realtime Playground

> This repo is rendering a multiplayer Uno card game server online, powered by socket.io.

## How to play
- The game is deployed on [heroku](https://lateinautumn.herokuapp.com/).
- Only minimum requirement has been finished for this app. Sorry for the lame styling and other unfinished features.
- This game requires at least 3 players to start.
- Game will start after a 5 second countdown when everyone in the lobby is ready or spectating.
- Enjoy!

## Installing Dependencies and Start Server

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run build (for deployment on Heroku)
npm run building
npm start
```
